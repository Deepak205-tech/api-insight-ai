1. Frontend (React/Vite + Tailwind + MagicUI)
User Input:
The user enters an API endpoint (e.g., GET /users) in the textarea input box on your React frontend.

Button Click:
When the user clicks the "Generate Test Cases" button, your frontend code sends a POST request to your backend API endpoint:

Loading State:
While waiting for a response, a spinner and message ("AI is generating your test cases...") are shown.

2. Backend (FastAPI app in main.py)
API Endpoint:
The backend exposes a POST endpoint /generate-testcases that receives the user's prompt.

Processing:
The backend receives the request and calls the function get_cached_test_cases(request.prompt). This function is cached for repeated prompts.

Delegation to AI Engine:
get_cached_test_cases calls generate_test_cases_internal(endpoint) (from your AI engine code).

3. AI Engine (FastAPI app in app.py)
Prompt Construction:
generate_test_cases_internal builds a detailed prompt for the LLM (Mistral via Ollama), including the endpoint and instructions for generating test cases.

Ollama API Call:
The AI engine sends a POST request to the Ollama server:

This is a local LLM running via Ollama, which generates the test cases.
Response Handling:
The AI engine receives the LLM's response, cleans and parses the JSON, and handles errors or retries if needed.

Return to Backend:
The parsed test cases (or error info) are returned to the backend.

4. Backend → Frontend
API Response:
The backend sends the test cases (or error info) back to the frontend as JSON, including processing time and, if there was an error, the raw LLM response.

Display:
The frontend receives the test cases and renders them in a beautiful table, grouped by Positive, Negative, Edge, and Security test cases.
